The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck Skip to content Menu Articles Books Courses Newsletter Podcast Log In My Account My Account Log In Sign Up Become a member Get a single membership for just $6.67 per month Sign Up The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck Written By Mark Manson Filed Under Happiness Motivation Personal Values Listen to this article 00:00 00:00 I n my life, I have given a fuck about many people and many things. I have also not given a fuck about many people and many things. And those fucks I have not given have made all the difference. People often say the key to confidence and success in life is to simply “not give a fuck.” Indeed, we often refer to the strongest, most admirable people we know in terms of their lack of fucks given. Like “Oh, look at Susie working weekends again, she doesn’t give a fuck.” Or “Did you hear that Tom called the company president an asshole and still got a raise anyway? Holy shit, that dude does not give a fuck.” Or “Jason got up and ended his date with Cindy after 20 minutes. He said he wasn’t going to listen to her bullshit anymore. Man, that guy does not give a fuck.” Chances are you know somebody in your life who, at one time or another, did not give a fuck and went on to accomplish amazing feats. Perhaps there was a time in your life where you simply did not give a fuck and excelled to some extraordinary heights. I know for myself, quitting my day job in finance after only six weeks and telling my boss that I was going to start selling dating advice online ranks pretty high up there in my own “didn’t give a fuck” hall of fame. Same with deciding to sell most of my possessions and move to South America . Fucks given? None. Just went and did it. Now, while not giving a fuck may seem simple on the surface, it’s a whole new bag of burritos under the hood. I don’t even know what that sentence means, but I don’t give a fuck. A bag of burritos sounds awesome, so let’s just go with it. The point is, most of us struggle throughout our lives by giving too many fucks in situations where fucks do not deserve to be given. We give a fuck about the rude gas station attendant who gave us too many nickels. We give a fuck when a show we liked was canceled on TV. We give a fuck when our coworkers don’t bother asking us about our awesome weekend. We give a fuck when it’s raining and we were supposed to go jogging in the morning. Fucks given everywhere. Strewn about like seeds in mother-fucking spring time. And for what purpose? For what reason? Convenience? Easy comforts? A pat on the fucking back maybe? This is the problem, my friend. Because when we give too many fucks, when we choose to give a fuck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times , that’s when life fucks us. Indeed, the ability to reserve our fucks for only the most fuckworthy of situations would surely make life a hell of a lot easier. Failure would be less terrifying. Rejection less painful. Unpleasant necessities more pleasant and the unsavory shit sandwiches a little bit more savory. I mean, if we could only give a few less fucks, or a few more consciously-directed fucks, then life would feel pretty fucking easy. What we don’t realize is that there is a fine art of non-fuck-giving. People aren’t just born not giving a fuck. In fact, we’re born giving way too many fucks. Ever watch a kid cry his eyes out because his hat is the wrong shade of blue? Exactly. Fuck that kid. Developing the ability to control and manage the fucks you give is the essence of strength and integrity. We must craft and hone our lack of fuckery over the course of years and decades. Like a fine wine, our fucks must age into a fine vintage, only uncorked and given on the most special fucking occasions. This may sound easy. But it is not. Most of us, most of the time, get sucked in by life’s mean trivialities, steamrolled by its unimportant dramas; we live and die by the sidenotes and distractions and vicissitudes that suck the fucks out of us like Sasha Grey in the middle of a gangbang. This is no way to live, man. So stop fucking around. Get your fucks together. And here, allow me to fucking show you. Subtlety #1: Not Giving a Fuck Does Not Mean Being Indifferent; It Means Being Comfortable With Being Different When most people envision giving no fucks whatsoever, they envision a kind of perfect and serene indifference to everything, a calm that weathers all storms. This is misguided. There’s absolutely nothing admirable or confident about indifference. People who are indifferent are lame and scared. They’re couch potatoes and internet trolls . In fact, indifferent people often attempt to be indifferent because in reality they actually give too many fucks. They are afraid of the world and the repercussions of their own choices. Therefore, they make none. They hide in a grey emotionless pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitied, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life. My mother was recently screwed out of a large chunk of money by a close friend of hers. Had I been indifferent, I would have shrugged my shoulders, sipped some mocha and downloaded another season of The Wire . Sorry mom. But instead, I was indignant. I was pissed off. I said, “No, screw that, mom. We’re going to lawyer the fuck up and go after this asshole. Why? Because I don’t give a fuck. I will ruin

The documents oftentimes are the preliminary results from an embedding-based retrieval system, and the reranker refines the ranks of these candidate documents and provides more accurate relevancy scores. Unlike embedding models that encode queries and documents separately, rerankers are cross-encoders that jointly process a pair of query and document, enabling more accurate relevancy prediction. Thus, it is a common practice to apply a reranker on the top candidates retrieved with embedding-based search (or with lexical search algorithms such as BM25 and TF-IDF ). Model Choice Voyage currently provides the following reranker models: Model Context Length (tokens) Description rerank-2 16,000 Our generalist reranker optimized for quality with multilingual support. See blog post for details. rerank-2-lite 8000 Our generalist reranker optimized for both latency and quality with multilingual support. See blog post for details. Older models The following are our earlier models, which are still accessible from our API. We recommend using the new models above for better quality and efficiency. Our latest models listed in the above table will be strictly better than the legacy models in all aspects, such as quality, context length, latency, and throughput. Model Context Length (tokens) Description rerank-1 8000 Our generalist reranker optimized for quality. Multilingual support. See blog post for details. rerank-lite-1 4000 Our generalist reranker optimized for both latency and quality. See blog post for details. Python API Voyage reranker is accessible in Python through the voyageai package. Please first install the voyageai package and setup the API key . Voyage reranker receives as input a query and a list of candidate documents, e.g., the documents retrieved by a nearest neighbor search with embeddings. It reranks the candidate documents according to their semantic relevances to the search query, and returns the list of relevance scores. To access the reranker, create a voyageai.Client object and use its rerank() method. voyageai.Client.rerank (query: str, documents: List[str], model: str, top_k: Optional[int] = None, truncation: bool = True) Parameters query (str) - The query as a string. The query can contain a maximum of 4000 tokens for rerank-2 , 2000 tokens for rerank-2-lite and rerank-1 , and 1000 tokens for rerank-lite-1 . documents (List[str]) - The documents to be reranked as a list of strings. The number of documents cannot exceed 1000. The sum of the number of tokens in the query and the number of tokens in any single document cannot exceed 16000 for rerank-2 ; 8000 for rerank-2-lite and rerank-1 ; and 4000 for rerank-lite-1 . The total number of tokens, defined as "the number of query tokens × the number of documents + sum of the number of tokens in all documents", cannot exceed 600K for rerank-2 and rerank-2-lite , and 300K for rerank-1 and rerank-lite-1 . Please see our FAQ . model (str) - Name of the model. Recommended options: rerank-2 , rerank-2-lite . top_k (int, optional, defaults to None ) - The number of most relevant documents to return. If not specified, the reranking results of all documents will be returned. truncation (bool, optional, defaults to True ) - Whether to truncate the input to satisfy the "context length limit" on the query and the documents. If True , the query and documents will be truncated to fit within the context length limit, before processed by the reranker model. If False , an error will be raised when the query exceeds 4000 tokens for rerank-2 ; 2000 tokens rerank-2-lite and rerank-1 ; and 1000 tokens for rerank-lite-1 , or the sum of the number of tokens in the query and the number of tokens in any single document exceeds 16000 for rerank-2 ; 8000 for rerank-2-lite and rerank-1 ; and 4000 for rerank-lite-1 . Returns A RerankingObject , containing the following attributes: results (List[ RerankingResult ]) - A list of RerankingResult , with format specified below, sorted by the descending order of relevance scores. The length of the list equals to top_k if this argument is specified, otherwise the number of the input documents. Each element in the list is a RerankingResult object, which contains attributes: index (int) - The index of the document in the input list. document (str) - The document as a string. relevance_score (float) - The relevance score of the document with respect to the query. total_tokens (int) - The total number of tokens in the input, which is defined as "the number of query tokens × the number of documents + sum of the number of tokens in all documents". Example Python Output import voyageai vo = voyageai.Client() # This will automatically use the environment variable VOYAGE_API_KEY. # Alternatively, you can use vo = voyageai.Client(api_key="<your secret key>") query = "When is Apple's conference call scheduled?" documents = [ "The Mediterranean diet emphasizes fish, olive oil, and vegetables, believed to reduce chronic diseases.", "Photosynthesis in plants converts light energy into glucose and produces essential oxygen.", "20th-century innovations, from radios to smartphones, centered on electronic advancements.", "Rivers provide water, irrigation, and habitat for aquatic species, vital for ecosystems.", "Apple’s conference call to discuss fourth fiscal quarter results and business updates is scheduled for Thursday, November 2, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET.", "Shakespeare's works, like 'Hamlet' and 'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' endure in literature." ] reranking = vo.rerank(query, documents, model="rerank-2", top_k=3) for r in reranking.results: print(f"Document: {r.document}") print(f"Relevance Score: {r.relevance_score}") print() Document: Apple’s conference call to discuss fourth

pretend like he did. The point is that fucks have to be earned and then invested wisely. Fucks are cultivated like a beautiful fucking garden, where if you fuck shit up and the fucks get fucked, then you’ve fucking fucked your fucks all the fuck up. Subtlety #3: We All Have a Limited Number of Fucks to Give; Pay Attention to Where and Who You Give Them to When we’re young, we have tons of energy. Everything is new and exciting. And everything seems to matter so much. Therefore, we give tons of fucks. We give a fuck about everything and everyone—about what people are saying about us, about whether that cute boy/girl called us back or not, about whether our socks match or not or what color our birthday balloon is. As we get older, we gain experience and begin to notice that most of these things have little lasting impact on our lives. Those people’s opinions we cared about so much before have long been removed from our lives. We’ve found the love we need and so those embarrassing romantic rejections cease to mean much anymore. We realize how little people pay attention to the superficial details about us and we focus on doing things more for ourselves rather than for others. Bunk Moreland, not giving a fuck since 2002. Essentially, we become more selective about the fucks we’re willing to give. This is something called ‘maturity.’ It’s nice, you should try it sometime. Maturity is what happens when one learns to only give a fuck about what’s truly fuckworthy. As Bunk Moreland said in The Wire (which, fuck you, I still downloaded) to his partner Detective McNulty: “That’s what you get for giving a fuck when it wasn’t your turn to give a fuck.” Then, as we grow older and enter middle age, something else begins to change. Our energy levels drop. Our identities solidify. We know who we are and we no longer have a desire to change what now seems inevitable in our lives. And in a strange way, this is liberating. We no longer need to give a fuck about everything. Life is just what it is. We accept it, warts and all. We realize that we’re never going to cure cancer or go to the moon or feel Jennifer Aniston’s tits. And that’s OK. Life fucking goes on. We now reserve our ever-dwindling fucks only for the most truly fuckworthy parts of our lives: our families, our best friends, our golf swing. And to our astonishment, this is enough . This simplification actually makes us really fucking happy . Then somehow, one day, much later, we wake up and we’re old. And along with our gum lines and our sex drive, our ability to give a fuck has receded to the point of non-existence. In the twilight of our days, we carry out a paradoxical existence where we no longer have the energy to give a fuck about the big things in life, and instead we must dedicate the few fucks we have left to the simple and mundane yet increasingly difficult aspects of our lives: where to eat lunch, doctors appointments for our creaky joints, 30-cent discounts at the supermarket, and driving without drifting to sleep and killing a parking lot full of orphans. You know, practical concerns. Then one day, on our deathbed, (hopefully) surrounded by the people we gave the majority of our fucks to throughout our life, and those few who still give a fuck about us, with a silent gasp we will gently let our last fuck go. Through the tears and the gently fading beeps of the heart monitor and the dimming fluorescence encapsulating us in its divine hospital halo, we drift into some unknowable and unfuckable void.

who are curious and love to learn is that we can fall into the habit of continuously force-feeding ourselves more and more information, but never actually take the next step and apply it. We compile tons of research but never put forward our proposal. We gather untold business case studies but never pitch one potential client. We study every piece of relationship advice available but never ask anyone out on a date. We think weʼ’re not ready. We fear weʼ’re not prepared. We cannot stand the thought that there is one little piece of information weʼ’re missing that, if we had it, would make all the difference. Information becomes knowledge—personal, embodied, verified— only when we put it to use . Since nothing is ever truly final, there is no need to wait to get started. You can publish a simple website now, and slowly add additional pages over time. You can send out a draft of a piece of writing now and make revisions later when you have more time. The sooner you begin, the sooner you start on the path of improvement. Introduction 4 -----

You can publish a simple website now, and slowly add additional pages over time. You can send out a draft of a piece of writing now and make revisions later when you have more time. The sooner you begin, the sooner you start on the path of improvement. Introduction 4 -----

# **Accessibility** |Tags|Col2| |---|---| |Created|@September 14, 2023 6:15 PM| |Updated|@September 14, 2023 6:15 PM| ### Youʼ’re starting to understand the importance of accessibility–designing products, devices, services or environments for people with disabilities. Accessible designs allow users of diverse abilities to navigate, understand, and use your product. One way to better empathize with your users who identify as having a disability is to experiment with assistive technologies–which includes any product, equipment, or system that enhances learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities. When youʼ’re designing digital experiences like websites and apps, itʼ’s important to become familiar with the types of assistive technologies (ATs) that people might use to access it. Nearly all devices–especially computers, tablets, and smartphones–on the market today include some type of accessibility support. As a UX designer, itʼ’ll be important to become personally familiar with many types of the ATs covered in the video Assistive technology, so that you can provide easy-to-use and enjoyable user experiences for those users who depend on them to experience your product. Different device types and operating systems have different accessibility features available, and those features are updated all the time! The best way to learn about whatʼ’s available on the device youʼ’re using right now is to check the Help. Here are a few links to get you started: Google Accessibility is a YouTube playlist that includes general information about various assistive technologies and how-to videos for using accessibility features in Chrome and on Chromebooks. If youʼ’re using a Chromebook, thereʼ’s some additional guidance in the Chromebook Help. If youʼ’re an Android user, you can learn how to use accessibility features in the Android Accessibility Help. Microsoftʼ’s guide for accessibility features on Windows includes descriptions of all available features, along with links to how-to content for using accessibility features on a Windows device. Accessibility 1 ----- ### For Apple products, thereʼ’s Get started with accessibility features on Mac and the Accessibility Support page for iPhone. ## **Learn more about accessibility from Google** ### If youʼ’re ready to learn more about accessibility, check out this three-part series from Google UX researchers about building globally accessible products. 1. Designing for Global Accessibility, Part I: Awareness is everything outlines how you can increase your awareness of accessibility issues and check your assumptions about users. 2. Designing for Global Accessibility, Part II: Context matters explores why itʼ’s critical to consider logistics during the design process, in order to expand your appʼ’s usability and usefulness. 3. Designing for Global Accessibility, Part III: Be inclusive by default discusses how UX designers can make tactical decisions to create inclusive apps. You can also start to familiarize yourself with design principles that keep accessibility front-and-center by reviewing the Accessibility Guide for Google Material. Donʼ’t worry if the topics outlined in this guide are advanced or unfamiliar. Weʼ’ll cover some key considerations for accessible designs in more detail as you progress through this certificate program. For now, simply focus on laying a foundation for designing with accessibility in mind. As you progress through the certificate program, youʼ’ll complete activities that will continue building your knowledge and experience with designing for accessibility. Accessibility 2 -----


pit of their own making, self-absorbed and self-pitied, perpetually distracting themselves from this unfortunate thing demanding their time and energy called life. My mother was recently screwed out of a large chunk of money by a close friend of hers. Had I been indifferent, I would have shrugged my shoulders, sipped some mocha and downloaded another season of The Wire . Sorry mom. But instead, I was indignant. I was pissed off. I said, “No, screw that, mom. We’re going to lawyer the fuck up and go after this asshole. Why? Because I don’t give a fuck. I will ruin this guy’s life if I have to.” This illustrates the first subtlety about not giving a fuck. When we say, “Damn, watch out, Mark Manson just don’t give a fuck,” we don’t mean that Mark Manson doesn’t care about anything; on the contrary, what we mean is that Mark Manson doesn’t care about adversity in the face of his goals, he doesn’t care about pissing some people off to do what he feels is right or important or noble. What we mean is that Mark Manson is the type of guy who would write about himself in third person and use the word ‘fuck’ in an article 127 different times just because he thought it was the right thing to do. He just doesn’t give a fuck. This is what is so admirable—no, not me, dumbass—the overcoming adversity stuff. The staring failure in the face and shoving your middle finger back at it. The people who don’t give a fuck about adversity or failure or embarrassing themselves or shitting the bed a few times. The people who just laugh and then do it anyway. Because they know it’s right. They know it’s more important than them and their own feelings and their own pride and their own needs. They say “Fuck it,” not to everything in life, but rather they say “Fuck it” to everything unimportant in life . They reserve their fucks for what truly fucking matters. Friends. Family. Purpose . Burritos. And an occasional lawsuit or two. And because of that, because they reserve their fucks for only the big things, the important things, people give a fuck about them in return. Need Help Figuring out What to Give a Fuck About? Enter your email address below and I’ll send you a 50-page ebook on developing your own personal values. Get Ebook Your information is protected and I never spam, ever. You can view my privacy policy here . Subtlety #2: To Not Give a Fuck About Adversity, You Must First Give a Fuck About Something More Important Than Adversity Eric Hoffer once wrote: “A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding. When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by minding other people’s business.” The problem with people who hand out fucks like ice cream at a goddamn summer camp is that they don’t have anything more fuckworthy to dedicate their fucks to. Think for a second. You’re at a grocery store. And there’s an elderly lady screaming at the cashier, berating him for not accepting her 30-cent coupon. Why does this lady give a fuck? It’s just 30 cents. Well, I’ll tell you why. That old lady probably doesn’t have anything better to do with her days than to sit at home cutting out coupons all morning. She’s old and lonely. Her kids are dickheads and never visit. She hasn’t had sex in over 30 years. Her pension is on its last legs and she’s probably going to die in a diaper thinking she’s in Candyland. She can’t fart without extreme lower back pain. She can’t even watch TV for more than 15 minutes without falling asleep or forgetting the main plotline. So she snips coupons. That’s all she’s got. It’s her and her damn coupons. All day, every day. It’s all she can give a fuck about because there is nothing else to give a fuck about. And so when that pimply-faced 17-year-old cashier refuses to accept one of them, when he defends his cash register’s purity the way knights used to defend maidens’ virginities, you can damn well bet granny is going to erupt and verbally hulk smash his fucking face in. Eighty years of fucks will rain down all at once, like a fiery hailstorm of “Back in my day” and “People used to show more respect” stories, boring the world around her to tears in her creaking and wobbly voice. If you find yourself consistently giving too many fucks about trivial shit that bothers you—your ex-girlfriend’s new Facebook picture, how quickly the batteries die in the TV remote, missing out on yet another 2-for-1 sale on hand sanitizer—chances are you don’t have much going on in your life to give a legitimate fuck about. And that’s your real problem. Not the hand sanitizer. Way too many fucks given. In life, our fucks must be spent on something. There really is no such thing as not giving a fuck. The question is simply how we each choose to allot our fucks. You only get a limited number of fucks to give over your lifetime, so you must spend them with care. As my father used to say, “Fucks don’t grow on trees, Mark.” OK, he never actually said that. But fuck it, pretend like he did. The point is that fucks have to be earned and then invested wisely. Fucks are cultivated like a beautiful fucking garden, where if you fuck shit up and the fucks get fucked, then you’ve fucking fucked your fucks all the fuck up. Subtlety #3: We All Have a Limited Number of Fucks to Give; Pay Attention to Where and Who You Give Them to When we’re young, we have tons of energy. Everything is new and exciting. And everything seems to matter so much. Therefore, we give tons of fucks. We give a fuck about everything

Distance Formula d = √((x₁ – x₂)² + (y₁ – y₂)²) Finds the distance between two points in a plane. Slope Formula Slope = (y₂ – y₁) / (x₂ – x₁) Finds the slope of a line connecting two points. Slope Intercept Formula y = mx + b Finds the slope-intercept form of a line. Area of Triangle Area = ½ × base × height Calculates the area of a triangle. Sine (SOH) sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse Finds unknown angles in a right triangle. Cosine (CAH) cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse Finds unknown angles in a right triangle. Tangent (TOA) tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent Finds unknown angles in a right triangle. Pythagorean Theorem a² + b² = c² Finds the length of a hypotenuse in a right triangle. Standard Form of a Complex Number z = a + bi Represents a complex number. Modulus of a Complex Number |z| = √(a² + b²) Finds the modulus (magnitude) of a complex number. Conjugate of a Complex Number z̄ = a - bi Finds the conjugate of a complex number. Volume of a Cube Volume = a³ Finds total space occupied by a cube Volume of a Cylinder Volume = π × r² × h Calculates the space inside a cylinder Surface Area of a Sphere Surface Area = 4π × r² Finds total outer surface area of a sphere Elementary & Middle School 1. Area of Rectangle: area = length x widt h Kids will need to know this one in pre-algebra and later math classes. 2. Perimeter of a rectangle: 2(l + b) This will calculate the total of the outer lines of a rectangle. 3. Area of a square: a² Square the length of both sides to find the area of a square. 4. Perimeter of a square: 4 x a Multiply the length of the side of the square by 4 to find the perimeter. 5. Area of a circle: π x r² Use this to find the total area of a circle. 6. Circumference of a circle: 2π x r This formula calculates the length of the outside of a circle. 7. Find the Average: Sum of total numbers divided by the number of values. Useful in statistics and many more math word problems. Useful High School and SAT® Math Formulas These high school math formulas will come in handy in geometry, algebra, calculus and more. Plus, when SAT® season arrives, they will help teens succeed on the challenging math section. (Looking for more SAT® math help?

Cosine (CAH): Cosine = adjacent / hypotenuse Use this equation to find the unknown angles of a triangle. 16. Tangent (TOA): Tangent = opposite / adjacent This equation also can be used to calculate the unknown angles of a triangle. 17. The Pythagorean Theorem: a²+b²=c² This is used to find the length of a hypotenuse in a right triangle. In any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs of the right triangle. Complex Number Formulas These complex number formulas are essential for mastering advanced algebra, trigonometry, and geometry. Whether tackling high school math, preparing for the SAT®, or exploring higher-level math concepts, these tools will simplify challenging problems and build a strong foundation. 18. Standard Form of a Complex Number: z = a +bi Where a is the real part, and b is the imaginary part. 19. Modulus of a Complex Number: |z| = √a²+b² This equation calculates the distance of the complex number from the origin in the complex plane. 20. Conjugate of a Complex Number: z̄ = a - bi This formula is useful in rationalizing denominators or simplifying expressions. Mensuration Formulas (Essential Geometry Measurements) Mensuration is an important branch of mathematics that deals with the measurement of different shapes and figures. Whether calculating area, perimeter, or volume, these formulas are required for solving real-world problems in geometry. 21. Volume of a Cube: Volume = a³ Use this formula to find the total space occupied by a cube, where a represents the length of a side. 22. Volume of a Cylinder: Volume = π × r² × h This formula calculates the space inside a cylinder, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height. 23. Surface Area of a Sphere: Surface Area = 4π × r² Use this to find the total outer surface area of a sphere. Got math problems? We’ve got math solutions!

The 1-Minute Introduction That Makes People Remember You Forever | by Alessia Fransisca | Psyc Digest | Mar, 2025 | Medium Open in app Sign up Sign in Write Sign up Sign in Mastodon Psyc Digest · Explore human psychology and self-improvement with research-backed insights and actionable tips for mental wellness The 1-Minute Introduction That Makes People Remember You Forever A Behavioral Scientist’s Trick to Hack the “Halo Effect” Alessia Fransisca · Follow Published in Psyc Digest · 3 min read · Mar 19, 2025 -- 468 Listen Share Photo by Bundo Kim on Unsplash The Day I Bombed My Introduction (And What I Learned) “Hi, I’m… uh… John? I like… stuff?” That’s how I introduced myself at a conference once. Spoiler: No one remembered me. Fast-forward to today — I use a 1-minute trick that turns strangers into superfans. Here’s how to make your next introduction unforgettable (no “liking stuff” required). Why Your Brain Hates Basic Intros The “Broken Robot” Effect : “Name, job, hobby” intros are predictable → brains tune out. The Halo Effect : People decide if you’re smart/kind/interesting in seconds — first impressions stick like glue. Science Fix : Use storytelling + curiosity to hijack their attention. The 3-Part Formula (Steal This!) 1. The Hook: Start With a Story, Not Your Name Bad : “Hi, I’m Sarah, a marketer from Chicago.” Better : “I once accidentally emailed 10,000 customers a cat meme. Now I teach companies how to avoid my mistakes.” Why : Stories activate the brain’s “movie mode” → you’re memorable. 2. The Highlight: Add a “WTF” Detail Bad : “I love hiking.” Better : “I climbed a mountain in flip-flops to prove my mom wrong.” Why : Quirky details stick 5x longer ( Journal of Experimental Psychology ). 3. The Handoff: Make It About Them Bad : “Nice to meet you!” Better : “What’s the weirdest hobby you’ve tried?” Why : Questions force their brain to engage → they associate you with curiosity. Real-Life Example: From “Who?” to “Wow!” Before : “I’m Alex. I work in data. I like reading.” → Forgotten in 10 seconds. After : “I spent 3 years tracking how 500 people brush their teeth. Now companies pay me to fix weird habits.
